# Welcome to my first game of Tetris

### This will be a game of Tetris created in HTML, CSS, and Javascript

The goal of tetris is to keep the game going as long as possible.
The pieces fall down the screen and you can rotate them to best position the pieces so you can fill the rows of the game board.
When a row is filled it will be deleted and the game will add points to your score.
If your pieces continue to stack up the screen and they reach the top it will be a game over.


# The controls:

You will be able to move the piece in the window using the arrow keys.

Move Left: arrow left

Move Right: arrow right

Speed up piece fall: arrow down

Score will increase by 100 points for each row that is completely filled with pieces.

rotate: arrow up

Start button will change to pause button once it is pressed and will chagen back when clicked again.

Reset button will clear the board and your score so you can start a new game from scratch.

Instrucitons button will open a message giving the player details on how to play the game and how the score is calculated.

### Github-Pages Issue

When creating this project on my local machines I was able to load the project fine in a browser with and without using a live server extension however there is a problem with setting up Github-Pages so that people could try the game for themselves. The service seemed to be unable to search through the repository to find the CSS styling as it was inside a seperate folder. Once removed from the folder Github-Pages was able to read the style.css file except for the background image. I have removed the background image from all its folders but still when loading the page it brings back the error that it unable to be read. Going to try another image to see if there is a problem with the .jpg itself.

#### Author Issue

I wanted to take this opportunity to explain that I did not know I needed to have my github account linked to my partners computer as I had estabilished a ssh key with my github account email and thought that was sufficient. Therefore there are commits on this repository that display it from another author "Kayla Normore" however I was the only person to work on this project. I have since fixed the problem.
