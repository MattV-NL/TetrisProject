# Welcome to my first game of Tetris

### This will be a game of Tetris created in HTML, CSS, and Javascript

The goal of tetris is to keep the game going as long as possible.
The pieces fall down the screen and you can rotate them to best position the pieces so you can fill the rows of the game board.
When a row is filled it will be deleted and the game will add points to your score.
If your pieces continue to stack up the screen and they reach the top it will be a game over.


# The controls:

You will be able to move the piece in the window using the arrow keys.

Move Left: arrow left

Move Right: arrow right

Speed up piece fall: arrow down

Score will increase by 100 points for each row that is completely filled with pieces.

rotate: arrow up

Start button will change to pause button once it is pressed and will chagen back when clicked again.

Reset button will clear the board and your score so you can start a new game from scratch.

Instrucitons button will open a message giving the player details on how to play the game and how the score is calculated.

#### Author Issue

I wanted to take this opportunity to explain that I did not know I needed to have my github account linked to my partners computer as I had estabilished a ssh key with my github account email and thought that was sufficient. Therefore there are commits on this repository that display it from another author "Kayla Normore" however I was the only person to work on this project. I have since fixed the problem.
