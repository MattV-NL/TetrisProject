# Welcome to my first game of Tetis

### This will be a game of Tetris created in HTML, CSS, and Javascript

The goal of tetris is to keep the game going as long as possible.
The pieces fall down the screen and you can rotate them to best position the pieces so you can fill the rows of the game board.
When a row is filled it will be deleted and the game will add points to your score.
If your pieces continue to stack up the screen and they reach the top it will be a game over.


# The controls:

Move Left: arrow left

Move Right: arrow right

Speed up piece fall: arrow down

rotate: arrow up

Start button will change to pause button once it is pressed and will chagen back when clicked again.

Reset button will clear the board and your score so you can start a new game from scratch.
