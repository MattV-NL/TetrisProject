This will be a game of Tetris created in HTML, CSS, and Javascript

As the tetrominos fall down the screen, use the arrow keys to move the piece side to side to position it as best as you can to fill as many rows at the bottom of the board as possible. Once a row is completely filled the row will disappear and your score will increase.
You can rotate your tetromino to better position the piece as well.
You can also use the down arrow to speed up your piece to get it to the bottom of the screen faster.
